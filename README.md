Task Description ðŸ“„

ðŸ“Œ In this task :

ðŸ‘‰Create a model that will detect a car in a live stream or video and recognize characters on the number plate of the car.

ðŸ‘‰Secondly, it will use the characters and fetch the owner's information using RTO APIs (optional as currently there are no proper RTO's API available, that's why created a local API with which we can get the details of the vehicle but we can connect this API with AWS storage as a service or we also use google storage services to keep the data.)

ðŸ‘‰Create a Web portal where all this information will be displayed (using HTML, CSS, and js)
